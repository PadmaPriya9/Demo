//Branch commands

Prior to the introduction of git push -u, there was no git push option to obtain what you desire. You had to add new configuration statements.

If you create a new branch using:

$ git checkout -b branchB
$ git push origin branchB:branchB
You can use the git config command to avoid editing directly the .git/config file.

$ git config branch.branchB.remote origin
$ git config branch.branchB.merge refs/heads/branchB
